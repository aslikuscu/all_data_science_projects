## **Project Overview**
Heart disease is a critical health issue globally. This project uses machine learning to classify individuals as having or not having heart disease based on a dataset of medical features. 

The model is built using the Logistic Regression algorithm, which is trained and tested with a publicly available dataset. 

The project includes:
1. Data preprocessing.
2. Model training and evaluation.
3. Building a predictive system to test individual data samples.

---

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains 303 entries with 13 features and 1 target variable (`target`):
- **Features**:
  - `age`: Age of the individual.
  - `sex`: Gender (1 = male, 0 = female).
  - `cp`: Chest pain type (0-3, with 3 being the most severe).
  - `trestbps`: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg).
  - `chol`: Serum cholesterol (mg/dL).
  - `fbs`: Fasting blood sugar (>120 mg/dL: 1, else: 0).
  - `restecg`: Resting electrocardiographic results (0-2).
  - `thalach`: Maximum heart rate achieved.
  - `exang`: Exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = no).
  - `oldpeak`: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
  - `slope`: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0-2).
  - `ca`: Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by fluoroscopy.
  - `thal`: Thalassemia (1-3).
- **Target**:
  - `target`: Heart disease diagnosis (1 = disease, 0 = no disease).

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Prepare the dataset:
   - Ensure `heart_disease_data.csv` is in the project directory.

2. Train the model:
   Run the script to preprocess data, train the Logistic Regression model, and evaluate it:
   ```bash
   python heart_disease_model.py
   ```

3. Test the predictive system:
   - Modify the `input_data` variable in `heart_disease_model.py` with the desired sample data.
   - Run the script to get predictions for the sample.

Example of input data:
```python
input_data = (62, 0, 0, 140, 268, 0, 0, 160, 0, 3.6, 0, 2, 2)
```

---

## **Features**
- Preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and scale features.
- Train and test the Logistic Regression model.
- Evaluate model performance with accuracy metrics.
- Predict the presence of heart disease for new patient data.

---

## **Model Evaluation**
- **Training Accuracy**: ~85%
- **Test Accuracy**: ~82%

The model shows consistent performance in identifying heart disease risk.
